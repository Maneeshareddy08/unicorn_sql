The industries of Artificial Intelligence and Health also show large average valuations, indicating that these sectors are producing high-value unicorns. This suggests that high-tech industries like AI and healthtech are growing quickly in terms of both the number of companies and their financial impact.

3.What is the median time between a company's founding date and when it became a unicorn across different industries?

The median time it takes for a company to become a unicorn differs across industries. Data Management & Analytics takes the longest, with a median time of 8 years, while industries like E-commerce & Direct-to-Consumer, Edtech, and Fintech take around 6 years to reach unicorn status. The Auto & Transportation industry has the shortest median time at 4 years. This shows that more traditional or complex sectors like data analytics may take longer to reach unicorn status, while transportation and newer digital industries like e-commerce tend to have shorter paths to unicorn status.

The industries with the highest percentages of unicorns achieving valuations over $10 billion are Consumer & Retail with 12%, followed by Edtech with 7.14%, and Auto & Transportation with 6.45%. This indicates that consumer-focused industries and educational technology sectors are seeing rapid growth, with a notable portion of companies reaching the higher echelon of unicorn valuations. The retail and consumer industry, in particular, stands out as having a significant percentage of companies with very high valuations.

5. Which investors are backing the most unicorns across multiple industries, and how diversified are their investment portfolios?

Sequoia Capital appears to back the most unicorns across multiple industries, being involved in several investment partnerships such as with Qiming Venture Partners, Tencent Holdings, and Index Ventures. Other active investors include 8VC, which partners with firms like Tiger Global Management and Menlo Ventures, showing a broad reach. Firms like Greylock Partners, Accel, and General Atlantic also show diversification. Most investors seem focused on similar industries, as many of their investments fall under industry category "2," which may indicate technology or other high-growth sectors. However, a few, like AME Cloud Ventures and 5Y Capital, display a more niche approach, suggesting slightly less diversification compared to the larger firms.
